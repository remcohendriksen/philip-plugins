Frenck's Philip IRC bot plugins
==============

My collection of plugins for [the Philip IRC bot](http://github.com/epochblue/philip).

The Philip IRC bot framework was written by [Bill Israel](http://billisrael.info/) in the PHP programming language.
The purpose of his project is to allow people to create fun, simple IRC bots with minimal overhead or complexity.

Funny, this project has exactly the same goal! :)
It allows you to create you a fun and simple IRC bot with even less overhead and/or complexity by
providing you with a collection of plugins.

 * PHP 5.3.3+
